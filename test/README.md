# Using NLP Engine C++ Library Files in C++

This is example code on how to use the NLP Engine's C++ library codes in a C++ program.

It assumes there are three analyzers in the analzyers folder. The name of the analyzers are the name of the analyzer folders.
The analyzers that appear in this example are legacy and some no longer exist. It is expected that programmers test with
their own set of analyzers.

1. taiparse (it has since been renamed to the parse-en-us)
2. corporate
3. noop
